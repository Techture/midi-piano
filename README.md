# JS Midi Piano using the AudioContext API

What I'm experimenting with:

• JS
• DOM traversal
• oscillator creation/manipulation

My goal is to build this out into a more interactive experience, where users can record their playback and share. This app will be a great way to share my music as well, and allow users to mix and create with pre-recorded samples/stems. This will be a lot fun to scale up and perhaps be developed into a PWA so it can be enjoyed offline.
